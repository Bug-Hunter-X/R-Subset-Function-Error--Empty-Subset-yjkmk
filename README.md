This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in R when using the `subset` function. The issue arises when the subset condition yields an empty data frame.  The code example shows how this can occur and offers a solution using a more robust approach to handle potentially empty subsets.  The solution focuses on checking the subset result's length before using it to prevent errors and unexpected behavior.
