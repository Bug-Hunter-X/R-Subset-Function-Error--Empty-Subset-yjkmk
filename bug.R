# This code attempts to subset a data frame based on a condition that results in an empty subset.
# The error arises when using the subset function with a logical vector that evaluates to all FALSE.

data <- data.frame(A = 1:5, B = letters[1:5])

subset_data <- subset(data, A > 10) # No values in A are greater than 10
